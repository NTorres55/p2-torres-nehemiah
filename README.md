# Issues I had:
1. I had styling issues with the code. I started with one idea in mind and when I hit a pause, I came back not knowing what I was doing. Instead of scrapping it all, I tried to pick up where I had but probably took longer because of it. 
2. I had problems with the hamburger functionality. Not sure what I needed to add - I ran through it a few times and once found a typo thinking it would resolve the issue but didn't.
3. Lastly, I couldn't get an API to work. I went through and found an API which I then had to find another thinking it would make the process simpler, but couldn't get it to function. I tried a random quote generator but couldn't get it to show anything.

# Resources:
1. I used recorded lectures, videos and readings from class.
2. (https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) I used w3schools for a few items on my project.
3. I also used several forums and Q&A boards to work through problems I had.
